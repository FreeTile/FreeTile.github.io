                    <p>
                        My name is Mark and I am a junior Game Developer with a specialization in PC
                        development. I love game development and acquiring new
                        information as I move forward. Additionally, I have great soft skills
                        in communication and problem-solving. Another of my strengths
                        is that I acquire knowledge very quickly and this allows me to be
                        efficient using new tools within a short time. 
                    </p> <p>
                        My ambition is to work for a cause keeping profit secondary. 
                        I'm searching for an opportunity where I can contribute to
                        creating wonderful experiences, learn from experienced
                        individuals, and grow as a developer

                    Using Python libraries such as TensorFlow, I developed and trained a model for automated trading on Binance using API.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To train the model, I rented servers with an A100 card from Nvidia. These maps were specifically designed for training neural models.
                    Training models turned out to be quite expensive, so at this stage this project has been put on the back burner for future ideas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    On Github you can find the basic version of the program with genetic selection files, training of the best individual and a script for trading on Binance using the Binance API.

                    My first full-fledged project, which I worked on during my last semester of college.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a first-person 3D horror game where the main character by chance enters an abandoned house, after which the door is locked, and the only way out is to reach the end and realize what happened in this place.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My roles were: Project manager, Lead technical engineer
                    <br>
                    Things I created for this project:
                    <br>
                        Character controller (Movement, crouching, head shaking etc.)
                        <br>
                        Drag & drop system
                        <br>
                        Lighting (Both dynamic and baked)
                        <br>
                        Events' triggers
                        <br>
                        PSX shader

                    A personal project I'm currently working on. It's in early stage of development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is a 2D RPG game with turn-based combat.<br>
                    <br>
                    Unique feature: death and multiple attempts are necessary here. The variety of builds and procedurally generated equipment provides replayability and pushes the player to learn the mechanics and create a personal style of play.<br>
                    <br>
                    All visual elements are currently placeholders and will be replaced by the release.
