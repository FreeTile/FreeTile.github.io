                        Have you ever heard about the best game developer in the world? That’s not me, but I’ll try my best to become him one day.
                        My name is Mark, I was born in Russia and moved to Canada to make my dream come true and create new video games.
                    </p> <p>
                        I really love inventing new worlds and concepts and implementing already existing mechanics into them. At some point it is my passion that I have turned into my career.
                    </p> <p>
                        I really believe that games are not only about money. It is a form of digital art, and I hope, in the future I will create not regular games, but really unique creations that can bring new experiences to everyone.
                        I would be glad to join a team to create games and learn something new. This would allow me to fulfill my potential in the game industry.

                    <p>
                        Using Python libraries such as TensorFlow, I developed and trained a model for automated trading on Binance using API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To train the model, I rented servers with an A100 card from Nvidia. These maps were specifically designed for training neural models.
                        Training models turned out to be quite expensive, so at this stage this project has been put on the back burner for future ideas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On Github you can find the basic version of the program with genetic selection files, training of the best individual and a script for trading on Binance using the Binance API.

                        This is a first-person 3D horror game where the main character by chance enters an abandoned house, after which the door is locked, and the only way out is to reach the end and realize what happened in this place.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It is a 2D RPG game with turn-based combat.

                        Unique feature: death and multiple attempts are necessary here. The variety of builds and procedurally generated equipment provides replayability and pushes the player to learn the mechanics and create a personal style of play.
                    
                        All visual elements are currently placeholders and will be replaced by the release.
