                        Have you ever heard about the best game developer in the world? That’s not me, but I’ll try my best to become him. one day.
                        My name is Mark, I was born in Russia and moved to Canada to make my dream come true and create new video games.
                    </p> <p>
                        I really love inventing new worlds and concepts and implementing already existing mechanics into them. At some moments this is a kind of recreation for me.
                    </p> <p>
                        Right now I am developing a slasher game. Although it is not published yet, I’m still proud I undertook this complex project, it fully shows my determination to create games and my skills as a game developer.
                        This project fully shows my skill set with Unity 3D, Blender (modeling and animations) and C#. It also reflects my ability to solve problems. I also have a good communication level, though I don’t have a fairly high level of language.
                    </p>  <p>
                        I really believe that games are not only about money. It’s like art, but in the digital world, and I hope, in the future I will create not regular games, but really unique creations that can bring new experiences for everyone.
                        I would be glad to join a team to create games and learn something new. This would allow me to fulfill my potential in the game industry.

                    <p>
                        Using Python libraries such as TensorFlow, I developed and trained a model for automated trading on Binance using API.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To train the model, I rented servers with an A100 card from Nvidia. These maps were specifically designed for training neural models.
                        Training models turned out to be quite expensive, so at this stage this project has been put on the back burner for future ideas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On Github you can find the basic version of the program with genetic selection files, training of the best individual and a script for trading on Binance using the Binance API.

                        During our second semester we created a Flappy Bird Clone game using HTML, CSS and Phaser, a library for creating web games.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The purpose of this project was to understand a scripting language and work with the position, rotation, and velocity of objects.

                        This is also a Phaser project. But this time we created a 2D platformer.

                        Technically, this project is similar to the previous one, but this time we worked more with handling input from the player.
